abstract = {This paper considers two post-Gricean attempts to provide an explanatory account of verbal irony. The first treats irony as an echoic use of language in which the speaker tacitly dissociates herself from an attributed utterance or thought. The second treats irony as a type of pretence in which the speaker âmakes as ifâ to perform a certain speech act, expecting her audience to see through the pretence and recognise the mocking or critical attitude behind it. The two approaches have sometimes been seen as empirically or theoretically indistinguishable, and several hybrid accounts incorporating elements of both have been proposed. I will argue that the echoic and pretence accounts are distinguishable on both theoretical and empirical grounds, and that while echoic use is essential to standard cases of verbal irony, pretence is not. However, the term irony has been applied to a very wide range of phenomena, not all of which can be explained in the same way, and I will end by briefly mentioning some less central cases where varieties of pretence or simulation do indeed achieve ironical effects.}

    abstract = "We consider the distinction between intended and perceived sarcasm in the context of textual sarcasm detection. The former occurs when an utterance is sarcastic from the perspective of its author, while the latter occurs when the utterance is interpreted as sarcastic by the audience. We show the limitations of previous labelling methods in capturing intended sarcasm and introduce the iSarcasm dataset of tweets labeled for sarcasm directly by their authors. Examining the state-of-the-art sarcasm detection models on our dataset showed low performance compared to previously studied datasets, which indicates that these datasets might be biased or obvious and sarcasm could be a phenomenon under-studied computationally thus far. By providing the iSarcasm dataset, we aim to encourage future NLP research to develop methods for detecting sarcasm in text as intended by the authors of the text, not as labeled under assumptions that we demonstrate to be sub-optimal.",

abstract = {Automatic sarcasm detection is the task of predicting sarcasm in text. This is a crucial step to sentiment analysis, considering prevalence and challenges of sarcasm in sentiment-bearing text. Beginning with an approach that used speech-based features, automatic sarcasm detection has witnessed great interest from the sentiment analysis community. This article is a compilation of past work in automatic sarcasm detection. We observe three milestones in the research so far: semi-supervised pattern extraction to identify implicit sentiment, use of hashtag-based supervision, and incorporation of context beyond target text. In this article, we describe datasets, approaches, trends, and issues in sarcasm detection. We also discuss representative performance values, describe shared tasks, and provide pointers to future work, as given in prior works. In terms of resources to understand the state-of-the-art, the survey presents several useful illustrations—most prominently, a table that summarizes past papers along different dimensions such as the types of features, annotation techniques, and datasets used.},

    abstract = { Recognizing both literal and figurative meanings is crucial to understanding usersâ opinions on various topics or events in social media. Detecting the sarcastic posts on social media has received much attention recently, particularly because sarcastic comments in the form of tweets often include positive words that represent negative or undesirable characteristics. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was used to understand the application of different machine learning algorithms for sarcasm detection in Twitter. Extensive database searching led to the inclusion of 31 studies classified into two groups: Adapted Machine Learning Algorithms (AMLA) and Customized Machine Learning Algorithms (CMLA). The review results revealed that Support Vector Machine (SVM) was the best and the most commonly used AMLA for sarcasm detection in Twitter. In addition, combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and SVM was found to offer a high prediction accuracy. Moreover, our result showed that using lexical, pragmatic, frequency, and part-of-speech tagging can contribute to the performance of SVM, whereas both lexical and personal features can enhance the performance of CNN-SVM. This work also addressed the main challenges faced by prior scholars when predicting sarcastic tweets. Such knowledge can be useful for future researchers or machine learning developers to consider the major issues of classifying sarcastic posts in social media. }
